# DÂ³ PRG Redirects for OXID eShop

For forms sent via the FORM method, the browser's back function can only be used after the form has been resent. Depending on the browser, prompts will be shown. The additional sending can trigger unwanted actions.

By applying an additional GET request to the source address, the additional sending is prevented at the first "back". (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get))

## Installation

This package requires an Composer installed OXID eShop as defined in [composer.json](composer.json).

Open a command line interface and navigate to the shop root directory (parent of source and vendor). Execute the following command. Adapt the paths to your environment.

```bash
php composer require d3/prg-redirects:^2.0
``` 

Activate the module in the admin area of the shop in "Extensions -> Modules".

## Usage

In the "Settings" tab, activate all controllers that are to use this additional redirection.

## Extensibility

In principle, every controller can be equipped with this technology. If a controller is missing, it is welcome to add it. Note the handling of special cases, e.g. if the sending of the form was not successful and forwarding would interfere with error handling.
